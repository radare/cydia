fast, scalable, distributed revision control system (obsolete)
Git is popular version control system designed to handle very large projects with speed and efficiency; it is used for many high profile open source projects, most notably the Linux kernel.

Git falls in the category of distributed source code management tools. Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with full revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a central server.

This is a transitional dummy package. The 'git-core' package has been renamed to 'git', which has been installed automatically. This git-core package is now obsolete, and can safely be removed from the system if no other package depends on it.
