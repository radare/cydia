Larry Wall's Practical Extraction and Report Language
An interpreted scripting language, known among some as "Unix's Swiss Army Chainsaw".

Perl is optimised for scanning arbitrary text files and system administration. It has built-in extended regular expression matching and replacement, a data-flow mechanism to improve security with setuid scripts and is extensible via modules that can interface to C libraries.
