lisp-like general purpose scripting language
newLISP is a Lisp-like, general-purpose scripting language. It is especially well-suited for applications in AI, web search, natural language processing, and machine learning. Because of its small resource requirements, newLISP is also excellent for embedded systems applications. Most of the functions you will ever need are already built in. This includes networking functions, support for distributed and parallel processing, and Bayesian statistics.
